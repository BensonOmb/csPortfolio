  * <i>The Webpage was a good intro to this school year and I found it interesting how we learned about what actual webistes use. At first I thought I was actually good at this subject, but when other kids made their websites I realized how little I know about everything.</i>

 <details><summary><b>Lightning </b></summary>
 <p>
  
  * [here](https://bensonomb.github.io/lightning2/index.html)
  * <i>The Lightning lab was really cool to look at, but I only figuired out how it worked after I finished, when I had time to think it over. It was fun but I really struggled with the major concepts like connecting different classes. I employed my tactic of using random numbers in my code and seeing what happens, then once something cool comes out I go back and see why that is. It comes up with some pretty funky stuff.</i>

<details><summary><b> Dice </b></summary>
 <p>
  
  * [here](https://bensonomb.github.io/dice3/)
  * <i>I was completely and utterly lost on Dice. I had no idea where to start and I even struggled on the minor code. To me, the major concept code like the scanner class is very difficult to wrap my brain around, but In Dice the smaller code (for loops and such) was 
  a challenge by itself. I employed the help of Dr.R, my classmates and even the internet to figuire out why my dice were so wonky, but it was never fixed.</i>

 <details><summary><b> Chemotaxis </b></summary>
 <p>
  
  * [here](https://bensonomb.github.io/chemotaxis4/)
  * <i>Chemotaxis was really cool because it had alot of potential to create some fun games. It reminded me of the final project from AP Comp Sci and I wish we had more time to explore the possibilities and really explore what chemotaxis could be. I found the real life application in biology to be cool as well, and I can imagine this code being used for studies.</i>

<details><summary><b> Starfield </b></summary>
 <p>
  
  * [here](https://bensonomb.github.io/starfield5/)
  *<i> I was outstanded by what the other people made, and I realized just how much I suck at Computer Science. This is the lab I wish was more relaxed with the due date, because it had alot of potential for really awesome code. After seeing some of the 3D projects I was inspired to try something like that but didn't get a chance. I hope we do something in the future similar to this.</i>

   * <i>The college presentation was really weird for me, because I did it on my backup college and thus didnt really care about it. I was also caught off-guard presenting day one and I really wish I could have done more research. I didnt focus on the Computer Science part of St.Thomas because if I go there I will go engineering. But I should have done a better job.</i>

<details><summary><b> Hard Code! </b></summary>
    

  <br/><br/>The following code was difficult because I had trouble finding out how to move the ball in this certain way, I got past it by trying alot of different, and mostly random code and finding out what happened. It took a long time but the trail and error method really helped because it not only showed solutions but also got my brain to think in other areas besides the one way I normal think.
<p>


<i>class OddballParticle implements Particle {
  double x;
  double y;
  double speed;
  double angle=(Math.PI*2);
  int random;
  
  int clr;
  OddballParticle(int x, int y) {
    this.x=x;
    this.y=y;
    clr=((int)(Math.random()*245)+10);
  }



  public void move() {
    speed=Math.random()*5;
    angle+=.025;

    x+=Math.cos(angle)*speed;
    y+=Math.sin(angle)*speed;
     
  }
  public void show() {
    noStroke();
    fill(clr,clr,clr);
    ellipse(width/2,height/2, (int)((.5)*x), (int)((.5)*y)); </i>

<details><summary><b> 2 sources of Pride </b></summary>
 <p>
  <i> I am proud of how I have slowly understood more and more of the grand concepts of Code, which have always been a struggle for me. When I think of the classes from last year, I can finally identify what I was doing and what the code that was given to us was doing. I feel like my grand understanding of code has increased. I am also proud of how much I know about exceptions. I really threw alot of time to learning about what try catch methods do and theyre honeslty one of the only concepts I understand from this year so far. </i>
